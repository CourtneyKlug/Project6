This panda3d project allows you to take a gander at some planets, 
and a space station, all of which are located in an unknown part of the universe. 
You can also see the x y and z circles, a gathering of drones over a planet, and drones that make
the seams of a baseball over a different planet. The drones are our friend by the way. You're seeing all of this from the perspective of the Player SpaceShip. 
This machine can move left, right, up, down, and it can even roll to the left or the right. It can propel
fowards too of course. It's also able to bump into the 6 planets, the universe itself, the drones, and the x y z circle defenses.
Shooting missiles happens to be its specialty, and the missiles disappear after a few sceonds of being shot out. You'll also have a little help
from a hud element that will make it easier for you to aim at the objects you want to direct to. The bullets will destroy the planets, the Space Station, 
the Drones, and the meteors that surround the planets outside or inside. You can also adjust the size of the camera defense area by pressing the "o" or "p" key. 
This will make defense even tighter for you! This is part 6 of the Space Jam project.
